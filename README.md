Notey-Django-React is a note-taking application developed using Django and React, following a tutorial by Code with Clinton. The app allows users to create and manage notes efficiently.

Customization:

Responsive Design: Notes are displayed with uniform height, arranged in 3 columns on large screens, 2 columns on medium screens, and 1 column on small screens. The navbar is also responsive.

Search Functionality: Displays all notes when the search bar is empty, providing a comprehensive view of all notes.

Note: These responsive design changes were made by me and are not part of the original tutorial.

Tutorial: This project is based on the tutorial by Code with Clinton. You can view the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHc9AfHllwc) to learn more about the development process.
